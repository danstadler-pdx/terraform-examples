test 1:

1:
token permissions: full admin, nothing else specified
leave everthing uncommented (including dashboard TF files)
- taa, tad several times - everything just works

2:
step permissions down to just "alerting"
[wait before testing?]
- taa: see failures on folders and datasoures
- review in UI - note that Contact Points and Notification Templates need page refresh
- tad: should be able to delete everything that was created

3: 
leave permissions at alerting
commment out the dashboards files
- taa
- output:

Error: failed to create folder: [POST /folders][403] createFolderForbidden 
{"message":"You'll need additional permissions to perform this action. Permissions needed: folders:create"}

Error: [POST /datasources][403] addDataSourceForbidden
{"message":"You'll need additional permissions to perform this action. Permissions needed: datasources:create"}


-----
- try tad at this point

- add permissions folder:create
- taa

problems at this point:

alert folder:		no TF error, but the UI doesn't show my folder
alert rule group:	^^
alert rule:			^^
team alias:			succeeded
custom template:	succeeded
datasource: 		TF shows failure - permissions (should we even be creating this)
dashboard folder:	(still commented)
dashboard: 			(still commented)


-----
- try tad

problems at this point: now we get to this:

Error: error reading folder with ID`0:bedyukalgzcw0f`: 
[DELETE /folders/{folder_uid}][403] deleteFolderForbidden 
{"message":"You'll need additional permissions to perform this action. Permissions needed: folders:delete"}

The folder seems to have been created with this set of permissions
We can't see it in the UI
We can't delete it


-----
try: move permissions back to full admin, then tad
- folder can be deleted at this point


What are our recommendations at this point?
How would a team deal with this? Would they have to get Central Olly involved?
How long would that take?
What does this do for the customer's impression of working with Grafana Cloud?



Theories:

- a folder created but with no alert groups/rules in it is not visible in the UI:
https://grafana.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/125583

- why can't the user just delete it, if they were able to create it







API/Scripting ideas

run terraform

go to the swagger UI:
https://danstadler1.grafana.net/swagger

callout: schema and authorization

show a call 
show that you can copy the CURL command to the command line
show that you can use this URL to import the API into Postman
- https://danstadler1.grafana.net/public/api-merged.json

use it:

get all folders
- use jq to find the new folder, and get its UID

get folder by UID
- show that you can also get it by ID
